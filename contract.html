    <main>
       <p>I,<a href="https://tdscott1978.github.io/web215/intro.html">Terrell D. Scott</a>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2022, WEB215, Adv Markup and Scripting   with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.</p>

       <p> I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. </p>
    
       <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
